  <li title="question">Q: How do I build ReactOS Source?</li>
  <li title="Answer"> A: Start RosBE and type "make bootcd" or "make
livecd" to generate ReactOS ISO files from the source. If the ReactOS
Source is not available in the specified default folder you, it will
ask to download it for you.<br>
  </li>
  <li>&nbsp;</li>
  <li title="question"> Q: I have a Multi CPU/Core system. Can I speed
up the build process somehow? </li>
  <li title="Answer"> A: Yes, you can. Just use "makex" instead of the
"make" Command. "makex" checks for the number of processors/cores in
your system and optimizes the build according to that number. </li>
  <li>&nbsp;</li>
  <li title="question">Q: How/Where can I get the ReactOS source code?</li>
  <li title="Answer"> A: You can retrieve it with any SVN client from: <a
 href="svn://svn.reactos.org/reactos/trunk/reactos">
svn://svn.reactos.org/reactos/trunk/reactos</a> &nbsp;RosBE itself has
a SVN command line client and a lite variant for new users called
"ssvn" (SimpleSVN) included. If you want to get the source tree, type
"ssvn create" and it copies all code to the default source folder you
set during installation. </li>
  <li>&nbsp;</li>
  <li title="question">Q: How can I update the ReactOS source code?</li>
  <li title="Answer">A: Just type "ssvn update".</li>
  <li>&nbsp;</li>
  <li title="Question"> Q: Can I see somewhere if my source tree is up
to date? </li>
  <li title="Answer">A: Yes, just type "ssvn status".</li>
  <li>&nbsp;</li>
  <li title="Question"> Q: My source tree seems corrupted / updating
was aborted etc... and now I cannot update it anymore... What can I do?
  </li>
  <li title="Answer"> A: You need to clean it up. Type "ssvn cleanup"
and wait. After that type "ssvn update" and it runs again. </li>
</ul>
Q: How can I build ReactOS for another Architecture?<br>
A: Download the specific GCC Arch Plugin from sf.net eg the x86_64 one
and install it. Afterwards you will have a new Shortcut for a arch
specific RosBE. Additionally you can use charch command, like this
"charch amd64"<br>
<br>
Q: How can I use another GCC Compiler for building?<br>
A: Use our chdefgcc command. It changes the GCC Compiler temporary for
this session. Use it like this for using another host GCC: "chdefgcc
C:\path\to\gcc host"<br>
<br>
Q: How do I clean up my Source tree?<br>
A: Use "clean all" to tidy up the tree from all built stuff and
removing all logs too.<br>
<br>
Q: How do I update RosBE?<br>
A: Subversion Updates can be loaded via "update" command. It detects
the updates you already installed and shows you new ones if existant.
It tells you what they change and asks you to install them. If you
choose to skip one, it asks you if you want to be reminded again of
this Update next time. If you choose "no", it wont show up anymore
again.<br>
Version Updates are onley be released as Setup. Uninstall the old
Version and install the new one.<br>
<br>
Q: How does this shortcut Tool work?<br>
A: Just type "scut SCUTNAME C:\path\to\scut" and it generated a
chortcut you can reach via "scut SCUTNAME" If you wish, you even can
make a shortcut default, which means it will be loaded on startup all
the time.<br>
