The RosBE Configurator is the Main app to change more advanced Settings
for Look and Feel and in the Build Process.<br>
As you can see, it is possible to edit the font and background color
with RosBE Configurator. Additionally you can check the look in the
Preview below.<br>

<div style="text-align: left;"><br>

You can
switch on/off showing the time the build process needed.<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">2.</span>
A new feature
in Version 1.0 is the usage of CCache which can speed up the build
process for ~5-10%
for a cost of ~1,5 GB of Cache size (BEWARE: First Build Process is
waay slower due to Cache building process. The first sped up build
process will be the second one).<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">3.</span>
Stripped Output might help if you want
to use ReactOS on a PC with less than 48 MB RAM, because stripped apps
use less RAM and are smaller.<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">4.</span><span
 style="font-weight: bold;"></span> NoStrip Files for Debugging are
being generated. Don't use 4. and 5. together!<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">5.</span>
Here you can set another GCC Compiler as the Active one in RosBE.<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">6.</span>
You can switch off/on the logging and/or change te Path where the logs
will be saved to.<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">7.</span>
and <span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">8.</span>
are mainly made for Speed up the Build Process. By Changing the Output
to a RAMDisk you can Speed up the building for about 10-15%. But it
will cost VERY MUCH RAM. The fastest way would be to save the Source
(~300MB), the LOGs (some KB), the Object Files (!!!~2.3 GB!!!) and the
Output (~200 MB) to RAM Additionally you need some MB as Temp File
Buffer, too. So a maximum speedup would cost ~2.8 GB RAM. If you have
so much RAM, be happy and install a RAMDisk on it for building.
Otherwise you might need to keep OBJ on HDD.<br>
