### [Download latest .zip](https://github.com/GreenteaOS/Teapot/archive/kawaii.zip)

Click [this link to download .zip](https://github.com/GreenteaOS/Teapot/archive/kawaii.zip)

You may clone with `--depth 1` to avoid downloading whole repo history:

```sh
git clone --recursive --depth 1 https://github.com/GreenteaOS/Teapot.git
```

It is expected by default that you have a following folder structure:
`Tofita` and `Teapot` at the same parent folder (*not* within Tofita!).

This way you can simply run `build.bat` without any configuration.

### Reproducible builds

By using the same combination of Teapot binaries, Hexa compiler and Tofita source code,
you should have the same binary output. Shouldn't depend on the host system version or any
third-party libraries.
