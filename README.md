### [Download latest .zip](https://github.com/GreenteaOS/Teapot/archive/kawaii.zip)

You may clone with `--depth 1` to avoid downloading whole repo history:

```sh
git clone --recursive --depth 1 https://github.com/GreenteaOS/Teapot.git
```

### Reproducible builds

By using the same combination of Teapot binaries, Hexa compiler and Tofita source code,
you should have the same binary output. Shouldn't depend on the host system version or any
third-party libraries.
